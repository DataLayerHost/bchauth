# BchAuth Plugin for Caddy

BchAuth is a middleware plugin for Caddy that verifies user access based on Core Blockchain (CTN) transactions.
It utilizes PostgreSQL for transaction storage and Redis for caching to optimize performance.

## Features

- Verifies blockchain transactions to control access to resources.
- Calculates service periods based on transactions in CTN.
- Caches access results in Redis to improve efficiency.
- Configurable via the Caddyfile.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Build Caddy with the BchAuth module using `xcaddy`:

   ```bash
   xcaddy build --with github.com/yourusername/bchauth

            pg_conn_string "user=postgres password=secret host=localhost dbname=blockchain sslmode=disable"
            redis_addr "localhost:6379"
        }
        reverse_proxy localhost:5432
    }
}
```

### Parameters
